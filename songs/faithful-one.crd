{Faithful One}

[D]Faithful One, so un[Em/D]changing
[A/D]Ageless One, You're my [G/D]rock of [D]peace.
[D]Lord of all, I de[Em/D]pend on You.

[A] I call out to [D/F#]You. [G] [A]
Again and a[D/F#]gain [G] [A]
I call out to [D/F#]You. [G] [A]
Again and a[D]gain.

You are my [A]rock in [G]times of [D]trouble.
You lift me [A]up [G]
when I fall [D]down.
[D]All [A]through [D]the [G]storm
your [D/F#]love  [G]is the [D/F#]an[G]chor
My [D/F#]hope [G]is [Bm]in [A]you [D]alone.
